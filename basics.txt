static data is which dont change like homepage details like that in cache helps in fast processing

static data stores in browser is caching 

Dynamic Data which will updated like pricing and cant be stored in cacching


for any constants who had a value that cant be changed

for css we use kebab case 
for function camel case

maintain history of  version 


Distributed version control
every developer will work on it 
like made changes in new and approves code then merge into main 

open source
